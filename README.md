The Java Password Generator project was created to help users easily generate strong passwords based on their personal needs. It’s a simple program that allows users to specify the length of their password and select which types of characters they want to include like lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. After generating the password, the program evaluates how strong it is and gives a score based on how many different types of characters are included.

The program first asks users some simple questions, like how long they want their password to be and which character types they’d like to include. These choices ensure that users can customize their password to fit their security needs. To make sure the password is random and unique each time, the program uses Java’s `Random` class to pick characters. This randomness helps ensure that the generated password is not predictable or easy to guess.

One of the main challenges while building this was figuring out how to adjust the character pool based on user choices. For example, if the user wants lowercase letters, the program should add them to the pool, but if they don’t, it should leave them out. Another challenge was figuring out how to evaluate the strength of the password in a simple way. To solve this, the program checks if the password includes the selected character types and gives a score based on how many types are used. This score helps the user understand how strong their password is.

The algorithm used for generating the password is simple. The program randomly picks characters from the selected character sets and builds the password one character at a time. It uses a `StringBuilder` to efficiently put the password together. Once the password is generated, the program checks for the inclusion of lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and symbols using regular expressions. Then, it gives a strength score based on how many types are present.

An improvement made to the program was to make it more flexible. In the original version, the password could only include a few basic options, but now users can choose exactly what character types they want in their password. The strength evaluation was also made simpler, so users can easily see how strong their password is based on the types of characters it includes.

The program does not use files for input or output. Instead, it directly interacts with the user through the console. Users type in their choices, and the program displays the generated password and its strength score right away.

In conclusion, the Java Password Generator is a straightforward tool designed to help users create secure, customizable passwords. With its simple questions and helpful feedback, it’s a great starting point for anyone who wants to improve their password security. The program is easy to use and provides a good introduction to creating customizable software in Java.
